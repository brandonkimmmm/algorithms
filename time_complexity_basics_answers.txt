1. Time complexity is a function that estimates the time it takes for a program to execute. An algorithm's efficiency is calculated using time complexity.

2.  Runtime is the physical time durations of an algorithm.

3. It is calculated as a function of a variable n, where n is the input size and f(n) is the rate the algorithm grows as the input size grows.

4.
  a) Constant Growth Rate
  b) Logarithmic Growth Rate
  c) Linear Growth Rate
  d) Log-Linear Growth Rate
  e) Quadratic Growth Rate
  f) Cubic Growth Rate
  g) Exponential Growth Rate

5. Linear Growth Rate - when attending to a table as a waiter, the number of orders you need to take grows linearly as the number of customers grow.

6. n

7. n^2

8. 2^n

9. The linear function would be the most efficient.
